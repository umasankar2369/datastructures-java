Linear Search
In this tutorial, you will learn about linear search. Also, you will find working examples of linear search C, C++, Java and Python.


Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that searches for an element in a list in sequential order. We start at one end and check every element until the desired element is not found.

How Linear Search Works?
The following steps are followed to search for an element k = 1 in the list below.

Initial array
Array to be searched for
Start from the first element, compare k with each element x.
Element not found
Compare with each element
If x == k, return the index.
Element found
Element found
Else, return not found.
Linear Search Algorithm
LinearSearch(array, key)
  for each item in the array
    if item == value
      return its index
Python, Java and C/C++ Examples

// Linear Search in Java

class LinearSearch {
  public static int linearSearch(int array[], int x) {
  int n = array.length;

  // Going through array sequencially
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (array[i] == x)
    return i;
  }
  return -1;
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
  int array[] = { 2, 4, 0, 1, 9 };
  int x = 1;

  int result = linearSearch(array, x);

  if (result == -1)
    System.out.print("Element not found");
  else
    System.out.print("Element found at index: " + result);
  }
}
Linear Search Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)


Space Complexity: O(1)

Linear Search Applications
For searching operations in smaller arrays (<100 items).
