Stack Data Structure
In this tutorial, you will learn about the stack data structure and its implementation in Python, Java and C/C++.


A stack is a useful data structure in programming. It is just like a pile of plates kept on top of each other.

elements on stack are added on top and removed from top just like a pile of plate
Stack representation similar to a pile of plate
Think about the things you can do with such a pile of plates

Put a new plate on top
Remove the top plate
If you want the plate at the bottom, you must first remove all the plates on top. Such an arrangement is called Last In First Out - the last item that is the first item to go out.

LIFO Principle of Stack
In programming terms, putting an item on top of the stack is called push and removing an item is called pop.

represent the LIFO principle by using push and pop operation
Stack Push and Pop Operations
In the above image, although item 2 was kept last, it was removed first - so it follows the Last In First Out(LIFO) principle.

We can implement a stack in any programming language like C, C++, Java, Python or C#, but the specification is pretty much the same.

Basic Operations of Stack

A stack is an object (an abstract data type - ADT) that allows the following operations:

Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
IsFull: Check if the stack is full
Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it
Working of Stack Data Structure
The operations work as follows:

A pointer called TOP is used to keep track of the top element in the stack.
When initializing the stack, we set its value to -1 so that we can check if the stack is empty by comparing TOP == -1.
On pushing an element, we increase the value of TOP and place the new element in the position pointed to by TOP.
On popping an element, we return the element pointed to by TOP and reduce its value.
Before pushing, we check if the stack is already full
Before popping, we check if the stack is already empty

Stack Implementations in Python, Java, C, and C++
The most common stack implementation is using arrays, but it can also be implemented using lists.

// Stack implementation in Java

class Stack {
  private int arr[];
  private int top;
  private int capacity;

  // Creating a stack
  Stack(int size) {
    arr = new int[size];
    capacity = size;
    top = -1;
  }

  // Add elements into stack
  public void push(int x) {
    if (isFull()) {
      System.out.println("OverFlow\nProgram Terminated\n");
      System.exit(1);
    }

    System.out.println("Inserting " + x);
    arr[++top] = x;
  }

  // Remove element from stack
  public int pop() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
      System.out.println("STACK EMPTY");
      System.exit(1);
    }
    return arr[top--];
  }

  // Utility function to return the size of the stack
  public int size() {
    return top + 1;
  }

  // Check if the stack is empty
  public Boolean isEmpty() {
    return top == -1;
  }

  // Check if the stack is full
  public Boolean isFull() {
    return top == capacity - 1;
  }

  public void printStack() {
    for (int i = 0; i <= top; i++) {
      System.out.println(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Stack stack = new Stack(5);

    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);
    stack.push(4);

    stack.pop();
    System.out.println("\nAfter popping out");

    stack.printStack();

  }
}
Stack Time Complexity
For the array-based implementation of a stack, the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e. O(1).

Applications of Stack Data Structure
Although stack is a simple data structure to implement, it is very powerful. The most common uses of a stack are:

To reverse a word - Put all the letters in a stack and pop them out. Because of the LIFO order of stack, you will get the letters in reverse order.
In compilers - Compilers use the stack to calculate the value of expressions like 2 + 4 / 5 * (7 - 9) by converting the expression to prefix or postfix form.
In browsers - The back button in a browser saves all the URLs you have visited previously in a stack. Each time you visit a new page, it is added on top of the stack. When you press the back button, the current URL is removed from the stack, and the previous URL is accessed.
